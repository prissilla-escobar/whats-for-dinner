# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This app helps users choose what to make to eat. The user can select a side, main or dessert dish and the app will generate an option for them to make. The user can also choose to have an entire meal generated for them. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- git clone this repo to your local machine
- cd into that directory
- git open index.html to open the browser

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I was given 5 days to complete this project. I worked on the project for aproximately 4-5 hours per day. I am 3 weeks into the program. I am currently in the first of four modules.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
- [Prissilla Escobar](https://github.com/prissilla-escobar) - 2305 FE Mod 1 student at Turing School for Software and Design

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
This was the first time that I wrote my own HTML and CSS for an app. The learning goal was to be able to write my own HTML and CSS and be able to write JS to manipulate the behavior of the page.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- I really struggled with the nav bar of the page. I had to work to understand the differences of semantic and non-semantic elements in HTML and when to use them.
- Figuring out the best way to write CSS was a challenge because it seems as if there are just so many ways to get what you want to show on the page but we want the most concise way.
- I had never worked with radio buttons before so I did have to do research on how those worked. I also thought that I needed to use the input value on the button but there ended up being a method I could use.
